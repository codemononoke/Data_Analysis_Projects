# --> [Movie Rating Analysis](Movie_Rating_Analysis/Movie_Rating_Analysis.ipynb)

This repository contains a Python-based movie rating analysis project. The project utilizes datasets containing movie titles, genres, and user ratings to perform various analyses, including the distribution of ratings and identifying top-rated movies.

## Features

- **Data Merging:** Combines movie and rating datasets for comprehensive analysis.
- **Rating Distribution Visualization:** Creates a pie chart to visualize the distribution of movie ratings.
- **Top Rated Movies:** Identifies the top 10 most frequently rated movies with a perfect score of 10.

# --> [ðŸŽ¢ Roller Coaster Data Analysis and Visualization](Roller_Coaster_Analysis/Roller_Coaster_Analysis.ipynb)

This project analyzes and visualizes data from various roller coasters worldwide, exploring their characteristics such as speed, height, and introduction year. Using Python, the dataset is cleaned, prepared, and explored to reveal key trends in roller coaster design and performance.

## Features
- **Data Cleaning**: Irrelevant columns removed, duplicates handled, and data types standardized.
- **Data Visualizations**:
  1. **Top 10 Years for Coaster Introductions**: Bar chart of the most frequent coaster introduction years.
  2. **Coaster Speed Distribution**: Histogram showing frequency of different coaster speeds.
  3. **Speed vs Height**: Scatter plot revealing the relationship between speed and height of coasters.
